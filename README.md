### Hi! I'm Sean, nice to meet you. ðŸ‘‹

I am a full stack engineer who develops web and mobile apps. I work primarily with React, Python, and Swift. I do some dabbling in Kotlin as well for Android app development.

Currently developing [RoboEdit](https://roboedit.app) and [YuleLog](https://yulelog.com)

YuleLog is also available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yulelog/id1493430055) and very recently, the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yulelog.yulelog_android&hl=en_US).

In my spare time, I have also developed fun tools like [Monsters & Metadata](https://monstersandmetadata.com), a database and crowdsourced community game information website for the upcoming MMORPG [Monsters & Memories](https://monstersandmemories.com/).
