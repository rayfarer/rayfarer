### Hi! I'm Sean, nice to meet you. ðŸ‘‹

I am a full stack engineer who develops web and mobile apps. I work primarily with React, Python, and Swift. I do some dabbling in Kotlin as well for Android app development.

Currently developing [RoboEdit](https://roboedit.app) and [YuleLog](https://yulelog.com)

YuleLog is also available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yulelog/id1493430055).

In my spare time, I have also developed fun tools like Campmtime ([Web version](https://github.com/rayfarer/camptime) || [Python](https://github.com/rayfarer/eq-scripts/tree/master/camptime)) related to the classic MMORPG EverQuest.
